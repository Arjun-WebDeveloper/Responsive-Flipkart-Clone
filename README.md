<h4><b>In reference to the Flipkart Home Page, did addition of responsiveness by incorporating relative units and media queries.\</b></h4>
<br> 
<ol>

<li>Relative Units:
<ul>
<li>Utilized relative units such as rem, em, %, and vw/vh for dimensions, padding, and margins. This ensures the layout scales appropriately across different screen sizes and resolutions.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Mobile-First Approach:
<ul>
<li>Started by designing the layout for mobile devices with a screen width of 480px or less. Used a @media query with max-width: 480px to apply these styles.</li>
<li>Adjusted the layout for mobile screens, such as stacking elements vertically, resizing images and buttons, and ensuring text remains legible.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Tablet and Desktop View:
<ul>
<li>Expanded the design to support tablet and desktop views with a screen width of 768px or more. Used a @media query with min-width: 768px to apply these styles.</li>
<li>Modified the layout for larger screens, such as arranging elements in a grid, adjusting image sizes, and expanding the width of containers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Orientation:
<ul>
<li>Implemented a @media query for orientation: portrait to customize the layout when the device is held in portrait mode.</li>
<li>Adjusted the layout, ensuring elements like banners and footers are correctly positioned and sized for portrait orientation.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Aspect Ratio:
<ul>
<li>Used a @media query with aspect-ratio: 16/9 to apply specific styles for screens with a 16:9 aspect ratio.</li>
<li>Enhanced the layout for this aspect ratio by adjusting widths, heights, and grid configurations to make the most of the available space.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Additional Styling:
<ul>
<li>Implemented hover effects, button styles, and font settings to enhance the visual appeal and user interaction.</li>
<li>Ensured that the layout remains visually consistent and accessible across all supported screen sizes and orientations.</li></ul>
